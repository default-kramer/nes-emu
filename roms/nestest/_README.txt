I found the nestest.nes ROM at https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/Emulator_tests
This very useful ROM was created by kevtris.

I do not know if this ROM has any license, but kevtris responded "feel free to distribute it"
when I asked for permission to include it in a public Github repository.

The nestest.log file was apparently generated by Nintendulator.
